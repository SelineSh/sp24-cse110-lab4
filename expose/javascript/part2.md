1. 3, because prices.length = 3.
2. 150, because 300 * (1-0.5) = 150
3. 150, because Math.round(150 * 100) / 100 = 150
4. [ 50, 100, 150 ],
5. An error, because i use let and set on the for loop,so the console.log(i) can't get the defined.
6. An error, becuase discountedPtice use let and set on the for loop,so the console.log(discountedPtice) can't get the defined.
7. 150, becuase finalPrice is set out of the for loop, and change the value in the line 8 to 150.
8. [ 50, 100, 150 ]
9.  An error, because i use let and set on the for loop,so the console.log(i) can't get the defined.
10. 3, because it set length on line 4, and the length is equal 3.
11. [ 50, 100, 150 ]
12. A: console.log(student.name);
    B: console.log(student['Grad Year']);
    C: student.greeting();
    D: console.log(student['Favorite Teacher'].name);
    E: console.log(student.courseLoad[0]);
13. A: "32" since integers map to their exact string representation
    B: "1", because 2 is not a string so '3' is become a number and -2.
    C:"3", since null map to 0
    D:"3null", since '3' is map to their exact string representation
    E:"4", since true map to 1
    F:"0", since false and null are map to 0
    G:"3undefined", since '3' is map to their exact string representation
    H:NaN, since '- undefined' so undefined can't be a string and undefined in javascript is NaN, so when we -undedfined is get NaN
14. A:"true", because 1 is number so '2' is became number, and 2 is greater than 1
    B:"flase", because '2' is greater than '1'
    C:"true", because string '2' becomes a number 1, and 2 == 2.
    D:"flase", because string '2' and number 2 is different types
    E:"flase", beacuse true is equal to 1
    F:"true", beacuse it isn't 0, null, underfined, NaN,"". So it will retrun true.
15. == can change the string to the number and check. But === only can check two was same type.
16. part2-question16.js
17. [ 2, 4, 6 ], because we give the arry[1,2,3], and the callback is function doSomething. In the doSomething we time the number 2. therefore we get [2,4,6].
